# Challenge-2 Jeff Gilbert Portfolio 
## HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor & Accessibility

## Description

This first challege was to create a portfolio for myself. It includes all projects completed, and room for expansion to add in more projects in the future.

## Motivation

This portfolio is for me to be able to bring a quality accessible prodoct to interviews with prospective employers with the ability to show off not only my portfolio, but quick and easy access to all projects displayed within the portfolio.

## Comments

I have added comments for some features planned to add on in the future, as well in comments to more easily understand what actions each block of code is performing.
